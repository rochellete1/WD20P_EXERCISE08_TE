        <p>Barcelona's culture stems from the city's 2000 years of history. 
            Barcelona has historically been a cultural center of reference in the world. 
            To a greater extent than the rest of Catalonia, where Catalonia's native language 
            Catalan is more dominant, Barcelona is a bilingual city: Catalan and Spanish are 
            both official and widely spoken. Since the arrival of democracy, 
            the Catalan culture (very much repressed during the dictatorship) has experienced 
            a rebirth, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation 
            of new works. Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse 
            cultural life with theatres, concert halls, cinemas, museums, and high-value 
            architectural heritage.</p>

            <p>Barcelona houses a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. 
            The City History Museum, situated in a medieval building that used to be a royal 
            residence, explains the story of the city, and includes a visit to the Roman ruins 
            in the museum's basement. It also comprises the Museum-Monastery of Pedralbes, 
            one of the best examples of Catalan Gothic architecture, the Museum-House Verdaguer, 
            dedicated to poet Jacint Verdaguer, the Park Güell Interpretation Centre and 
            several other minor sites.</p>

        <p>The Museum of the History of Catalonia, opened in 1996, covers the 
            story of Catalonia since prehistoric times and administers the monuments that 
            belong to the Generalitat de Catalunya.[2] The Archaeology Museum of Catalonia 
            covers the story of Catalonia up to the Middle Ages, and of the cultures 
            it came into contact with, and also runs several other archaeological sites 
            in Catalonia.
            
            The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of 
            Romanesque art, including wall-paintings from Romanesque churches and chapels 
            around Catalonia that have been transferred to the museum, Gothic art from 
            the 13th–15th centuries, Renaissance and Baroque art from the 16th-18th centuries, 
            Modern art from the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century, 
            as well as the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection.</p>
